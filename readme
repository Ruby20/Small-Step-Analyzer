Project -2 (Advanced Compilers class) CS 6475 Fall 2013
  
A small step static Analyzer
In this project, we have created a static analyzer for a simple higher-order language. Specifically, we implemented the small-step formulation of Shivers's original 0CFA. 

I have used Prof.Matt's code from his analyzers link in the class webpage.
 Prof's code was based on A-Normal forms and I have made slight changes to make it conform to the CPS form.
  The grammar required us to handle Halt case. 
 To run this program, use make to compile.
 0cfa script takes a program and a variable. 
 use the ./0cfa program var to run this code.
 I have tested it against some cases after churchifying using the compile.rkt and hybridcps.rkt from Prof.Matt's blog to  generate lamdas.
